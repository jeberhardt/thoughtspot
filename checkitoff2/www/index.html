                <p>CHAPTER 1<br />MESSENGER OF MESSAGES</p>
                 <p>Already dressed in her hand-me-down Waterstone Academy uniform, Anni Moon took advantage of the last few quiet moments before she had to rush into the chaos of the school's kitchen for her morning chores. Any minute, the clock tower would chime and she would have to go. With her back against the tower's high windows, she sat in her usual spot on the lumpy window seat cushions. She was reviewing notes for her afternoon prep exam on the Periodic Table of Elements when something outside darted past the window.</p><p>The strange flying creature gave her such a jolt that she sprang off the cushions and, in the process, dropped her science book on her left foot. She hopped around in pain on her good foot, then tripped over a moth-eaten afghan, and finally knocked over a dustpan that was filled with ashes. The tower's paisley and mahogany-colored common room was engulfed in a cloud of soot, and for a moment, she couldn't see what was outside.</p><p>\"Anni Moon! Anni Moon! I need to speak with you, Anni Moon!\" said a small yet firm voice.</p><p>The creature flapped against the glass panes as it called her name. Anni stood stock still until the soot cleared and she finally saw it. It looked like a bat. No. A rat. No. It had bat-shaped wings but the body of a rat: whiskers, tail, and all. Whatever this creature was, its brown leathery wings were beating against the glass. It was wearing a little outfit, too, but strangest of all, it was talking to her.</p><p>\"Go away,\" she said and jumped behind the curtains. She pulled the drapes closed with one hard tug, and the tower's common room was cloaked in darkness. Panting, she leaned against the wall. She wanted to look outside, but she was afraid that the creature would see her.</p><p>\"Lexi? Lexi?\" Anni called out.</p><p>She fumbled in the dark over empty packing boxes that littered the floor, careful not to trip over the food tray she had left for Lexi before she opened the small, oval door.</p><p>\"You'll never...\"</p><p>The room was empty and Lexi's bed was made, which was strange. Lexi always overslept, and every morning, Anni woke her up. Not only were they best friends, they had been roommates for the last three years at Waterstone Academy for Girls.</p><p>Before Anni stepped inside, she saw it, lying on the floor, still perfectly folded with crisp edges. The letter-that awful, dreadful, hateful letter-that came three days ago, demanding that they pack up and move out of the tower common room. This room had been Lexi's home for as long as she could remember. It had been Anni's since she moved in three years ago.</p><p>Anni caught sight of Lexi's bedside clock. \"Eggs! Is that the time?\"</p><p>She was late for kitchen duty! How had she missed the clock tower's chime? She picked up Lexi's untouched tray, backed out of the room, and closed the door.</p><p>She raced over to the common room's double doors with the tray balanced against her hip, but before her hand touched the knob, the doors burst open. She lost her grip and the tray went flying. Cold hot chocolate and a gelatinous mass of marshmallows soared into the air and collided with a gooey peanut-butter-and-banana-honey sandwich, which landed on the door, floor, and Anni.</p><p>\"What is this?\" asked Rufous Finnegan, Waterstone Academy's security and all-purpose assistant. He was a young male dressed in a regulation gray uniform, and a proud germophobe who always wore a pair of sterile gloves. \"Food violation!\" His fist full of keys jangled as he took note of this infraction on his Waterstone Academy clipboard.</p><p>Anni sat on the floor, peeling pieces of bread and banana off her skirt. There was no hope for her favorite black-and-white-striped socks, a gift from Lexi; they were soaked in wet cocoa and she since didn't have another pair, she took them off to dry.</p><p>Finnegan glared at Anni. \"Why's it so dark in here?\"</p><p>\"No!\" Anni yelled.</p><p>He flung the drapes open, but there was nothing outside except gray clouds. Whatever Anni thought she saw was gone.</p><p>Finnegan scanned the room. \"These boxes are empty. What's wrong with you? Can't you read?\" His lips curled into a smile as he pulled an official Waterstone Academy embossed letter from his clipboard, waved it in her face, and read, \"Miss Alexa Waterstone and Miss Anni Moon: Please have all your belongings packed and ready for removal this Saturday afternoon. The new school owners will be moving in the following Monday. You must be ready to vacate the room by Saturday morning.\" He folded the letter and sneered at her. \"It's about time you two charity cases were pushed out. This is a Headmaster's tower, not a hideout for worthless little orphan girls. Speaking of which, you're late for kitchen duty, but I'm not here for you. Where's Lexi?\"</p>

<p>"Hey, Ivory, can you pass the orange juice?" Mom asks me, her hand outstretched.</p><p>"Here," I say, passing her the container of orange juice. I continue to eat my cereal, but steal a glance at her.</p><p>I can never get over how she looks almost exactly like me - except a little older and a few more gray streaks in her hair. Her face has some paint splattered on it, and the apron she wears all the time has the fresh smell of paint.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom's an artist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spends ninety percent of the day in her studio - working on new masterpieces to help pay off the bills. Of course, I have a job too. I won't let Mom do all the work. Especially not after my Dad passed away a couple years ago. Since then, all the bills have been weighed on her shoulders. But since I'm seventeen now, I can help her with a part-time job of my own.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm proud of my Mom. She was strong even when my father passed away.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiles at me and finishes her toast. After breakfast, she'll probably go back to her studio. She only comes out for meals, or if I was home and needed her for something.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm cool with it though. Mom <em>loves </em>what she does. Her green eyes - the same ones I inherited -  twinkle whenever she is in her studio. If my Mom is happy, I am too.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, isn't today the first day of senior year?" she asks me, taking a sip of her orange juice. A golden curl of her hair falls out from her bun. She pushes it behind her ear. "Are you nervous?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and yes," I respond. I take a spoonful of my cereal and stare at it. My stomach really isn't helping. It's all jittery. It happens <em>every </em>time I get nervous. "Do you think I'll be okay?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Honey, you've survived the last three years - you can do it again."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this is my last year and I'm really nervous," I tell her. <em>Also because of all the drama last year, </em>I secretly add.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reaches over the table and pats my hand. "You'll do fine." Mom looks at her watch. "Look at the time! You're going to be late!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grab all my belongings - my backpack, sweater, and phone. I run from the kitchen to the living room of our small two-story home and slip on my sneakers. There is a small mirror next to the door that Mom had put so we could see if we look okay before we head out. It's mostly because Mom forgets she has been working in her studio and has paint all over her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is the first day, I am wearing a new top and a fresh pair of jeans that I bought on my mini-shopping spree when I had saved enough money over the summer. My frizzy, uncontrollable dirty blonde - almost brown - hair is straightened completely. But, no matter how much I try, my sea green eyes pop out compared to my pale tan much needed skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bye, Mom!" I yell as I open the front door. "Don't loose track of time and forget to each lunch!" Sometimes, I would come home and find Mom dazed in her work - just as I'd left her in the morning.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't!" she yells back. "Have fun at school!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I close the door. <em>Like having fun at school is even possible, </em>I think as I lock the door. The air is chilly and the wind is blowing leaves off the trees in the front yard. I escape to the safety of my Honda Civic. Autumn is already starting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Radio pop songs boom from the speakers of my car as I drive to Brownwood High. People already have crowded the parking lot. I find a place to park. Brownwood, New York is a small town where everyone knows everyone since birth. One scandal here and you get judged for life.</p>

                <h1>The Perfect Victim</h1>
               <p>2AM</p><p>The city streets are quiet, still and virtually deserted.&nbsp; Hardly anything moves or makes a noise.&nbsp; The air hangs quiet and stagnant.&nbsp; No car lights penetrate the darkness.&nbsp; No streetlamps ignite the damp sidewalk.&nbsp; Only silver shards of moonlight reflect off the black pools of water that have collected in cracks and potholes along the pavement.</p><p>A young woman walks alone through the night.&nbsp; She stands out like a beacon in the darkness.&nbsp; Her clothes are bold and bright and seem to fit her skin like a glove, riding the generous curves of her body.&nbsp; Her bright pink shirt appears fluorescent in the moonlight and her stark white pants almost seem to glow.&nbsp; Her skin is pale and smooth.&nbsp; Her hair long and luxurious and bleach blonde.</p><p>She walks with boldness and confidence.&nbsp; Without fear.&nbsp; Her chin up and her shoulders back.&nbsp; Her hips sway naturally to the rhythm of her movement.&nbsp; Her bright pink heels strike the wet pavement in a steady, confident rhythm.&nbsp; She holds her zebra print purse slung casually over her left shoulder, allowing it to hang from just her first two fingers.</p><p>Just off the main street, lurking in the shadows, several figures watch.&nbsp; And wait.</p><p>She's moving steadily in their direction, unaware of the danger up ahead.&nbsp; She breezes past them without a hitch, her head still up high.&nbsp; Her forward momentum creates a light wind that slices through her hair and leaves a whiff of perfume in her wake.&nbsp; One of the figures releases a predatory growl.</p><p>The woman continues on her way, still acting for all the world as if she is entirely alone.&nbsp; She's heading to the waterfront.&nbsp; Boats and yachts sit quiet and abandoned along the dock.&nbsp; Distant city lights create flashes of colour on the wavering surface&nbsp;of the ocean.</p><p>The dark figures now begin to move in, some from the left, others from the right.&nbsp; There's seven of them in all, each one dressed entirely in black.&nbsp; Everything but their faces seem to disappear against the darkness.</p><p>They tread carefully, their feet landing without a noise on the dampened street.&nbsp; They don't say a word but move as if they can read each other's thoughts.&nbsp; They spread out across the road, blocking any possibility for their target to retreat.&nbsp; Their pace quickens and they tighten formation as they move in, swiftly, silently, like predators closing in on their prey.</p><p>The woman stops.&nbsp; For a split second she holds perfectly still.&nbsp; Then, slowly, she turns around, her body suddenly tense.</p><p>The men have formed a half-circle around her.&nbsp; A few grin when she sees them.&nbsp; A few leer and the rest clench the muscles in their legs, ready for the fear, the fight and the chase.</p><p>But the woman's face does not register fear or even surprise.&nbsp; She gazes levelly at the hooded figures surrounding her, as if appraising a selection of shoes she has a vague&nbsp;interest in buying.</p><p>\"Can I help you gentleman?\" her voice is calm and laced with a faint southern drawl.</p><p>There's&nbsp;no answer but a few quiet laughs reverberate through the group. Her lack of fear is unusual but not unheard of.&nbsp; Some of their victims are much quicker to understand the situation than others.</p><p>The woman lifts her eyebrows and continues to stare, like she fully expects an answer to her question.&nbsp;</p><p>Without any further warning, the men attack. They come at her all at once, in a well-organized pack, whooping and shouting and shoving each other out of the way.&nbsp;</p><p>The woman doesn't scream.&nbsp; She doesn't run.&nbsp; She slides one leg back for balance, bends her knees and crouches her shoulders, meeting their charge head-on.&nbsp; If the men had been paying closer attention, maybe they would have noticed the smooth, cat-like grace to her movements or the inhuman strength rippling through her body.</p><p>&nbsp;The man leading the pack is tall and lean, his black hood concealing his features.&nbsp; He charges at her with arms outstretched, fingers curled as if prepared to be wrapped around her throat.</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, the woman shoots forward to&nbsp;meet him.&nbsp; In one swift movement, she grabs his left arm by the wrist and pulls, sending him&nbsp;reeling head-over-heels across the pavement.</p><p>Another man comes at her, swinging his arms like a pinwheel.&nbsp; She leaps straight into the air and lands a roadhouse kick to the side of his face.&nbsp; The man drops, blood gushing from his nose and mouth.&nbsp;</p>
