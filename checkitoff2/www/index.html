                <textarea class="myTextarea"><p>2AM</p><p>The city streets are quiet, still and virtually deserted.&nbsp; Hardly anything moves or makes a noise.&nbsp; The air hangs quiet and stagnant.&nbsp; No car lights penetrate the darkness.&nbsp; No streetlamps ignite the damp sidewalk.&nbsp; Only silver shards of moonlight reflect off the black pools of water that have collected in cracks and potholes along the pavement.</p><p>A young woman walks alone through the night.&nbsp; She stands out like a beacon in the darkness.&nbsp; Her clothes are bold and bright and seem to fit her skin like a glove, riding the generous curves of her body.&nbsp; Her bright pink shirt appears fluorescent in the moonlight and her stark white pants almost seem to glow.&nbsp; Her skin is pale and smooth.&nbsp; Her hair long and luxurious and bleach blonde.</p><p>She walks with boldness and confidence.&nbsp; Without fear.&nbsp; Her chin up and her shoulders back.&nbsp; Her hips sway naturally to the rhythm of her movement.&nbsp; Her bright pink heels strike the wet pavement in a steady, confident rhythm.&nbsp; She holds her zebra print purse slung casually over her left shoulder, allowing it to hang from just her first two fingers.</p><p>Just off the main street, lurking in the shadows, several figures watch.&nbsp; And wait.</p><p>She's moving steadily in their direction, unaware of the danger up ahead.&nbsp; She breezes past them without a hitch, her head still up high.&nbsp; Her forward momentum creates a light wind that slices through her hair and leaves a whiff of perfume in her wake.&nbsp; One of the figures releases a predatory growl.</p><p>The woman continues on her way, still acting for all the world as if she is entirely alone.&nbsp; She's heading to the waterfront.&nbsp; Boats and yachts sit quiet and abandoned along the dock.&nbsp; Distant city lights create flashes of colour on the wavering surface&nbsp;of the ocean.</p><p>The dark figures now begin to move in, some from the left, others from the right.&nbsp; There's seven of them in all, each one dressed entirely in black.&nbsp; Everything but their faces seem to disappear against the darkness.</p><p>They tread carefully, their feet landing without a noise on the dampened street.&nbsp; They don't say a word but move as if they can read each other's thoughts.&nbsp; They spread out across the road, blocking any possibility for their target to retreat.&nbsp; Their pace quickens and they tighten formation as they move in, swiftly, silently, like predators closing in on their prey.</p><p>The woman stops.&nbsp; For a split second she holds perfectly still.&nbsp; Then, slowly, she turns around, her body suddenly tense.</p><p>The men have formed a half-circle around her.&nbsp; A few grin when she sees them.&nbsp; A few leer and the rest clench the muscles in their legs, ready for the fear, the fight and the chase.</p><p>But the woman's face does not register fear or even surprise.&nbsp; She gazes levelly at the hooded figures surrounding her, as if appraising a selection of shoes she has a vague&nbsp;interest in buying.</p><p>\"Can I help you gentleman?\" her voice is calm and laced with a faint southern drawl.</p><p>There's&nbsp;no answer but a few quiet laughs reverberate through the group. Her lack of fear is unusual but not unheard of.&nbsp; Some of their victims are much quicker to understand the situation than others.</p><p>The woman lifts her eyebrows and continues to stare, like she fully expects an answer to her question.&nbsp;</p><p>Without any further warning, the men attack. They come at her all at once, in a well-organized pack, whooping and shouting and shoving each other out of the way.&nbsp;</p><p>The woman doesn't scream.&nbsp; She doesn't run.&nbsp; She slides one leg back for balance, bends her knees and crouches her shoulders, meeting their charge head-on.&nbsp; If the men had been paying closer attention, maybe they would have noticed the smooth, cat-like grace to her movements or the inhuman strength rippling through her body.</p><p>&nbsp;The man leading the pack is tall and lean, his black hood concealing his features.&nbsp; He charges at her with arms outstretched, fingers curled as if prepared to be wrapped around her throat.</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, the woman shoots forward to&nbsp;meet him.&nbsp; In one swift movement, she grabs his left arm by the wrist and pulls, sending him&nbsp;reeling head-over-heels across the pavement.</p><p>Another man comes at her, swinging his arms like a pinwheel.&nbsp; She leaps straight into the air and lands a roadhouse kick to the side of his face.&nbsp; The man drops, blood gushing from his nose and mouth.&nbsp;</p></textarea>
